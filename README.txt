Generate a text file of all the classes used in your WordPress site.

== Description ==

With build tools like [purgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/) used by frameworks like [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) the need to remove all of the unused CSS classes from built CSS files has become an important factor. 

However, these tools can only look in source files for classes that should be kept. Therefore any classes generated by WordPress, such as classes used in the post editor will not be considered and overpurging occurs. 

This plugin allows solves this problem by:

* Logging all classes from page requests
* Generating a text file that can be used in your build process

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `wp-blaze-css` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit the pages that contain the classes you'd like to log and keep.
4. A text file in `/wp-content/uploads/blaze.csv` will be generated for use with your build tools.
